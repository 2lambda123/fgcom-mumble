# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The project will maintain the latest stable release. Security patches are usually included in the next ordinary release.  
Fixing security bugs has priority over other issues, so we try to fix them as soon as possible.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability, please report it as issue on the tracker, using the prefix `Security: ` so attention is rised.

Please describe the issue as detailed as possible. If possible, it would be cool if you could provide a patch when reporting.
